Welcome to my blog!

My name is Kyle Pitzen.  I've started a number of these kinds of sites over the years, but
I've never really stuck with them for long.  I've always wanted to write more, but I've never quite
found a workflow that works for me when it comes to writing, and I've never been happy with
the tooling available to make a comfy space both for writing and for reading.

This time around, I'm building this space with extensive input from current LLMs (Claude Sonnet, GPT 4o and o1 pro, and others) because they sort of seem like the current table stakes for modern engineering.
I'm excited to share my thoughts on:

- Software development and technical discoveries
- Music and art that I'm either creating or enjoying
- Lessons learned from building and shipping products
- Food and cooking
- Cloud infrastructure and the current landscape of its tooling

What makes this attempt different? I'm approaching it with a focus on maximizing my own joy and wonder while building - I want to have fun while doing this and I won't do it if it isn't fun,
and I'm committed to sharing things as I learn them, with the goal of helping others learn them too.

If you're interested in any of these topics, want to collaborate, or just want to connect,
you can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kpitzen.io), or [email me](mailto:kyle@kpitzen.io).

Hopefully this time will be different, and hopefully you'll find something here that interests you!
